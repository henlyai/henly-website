# Video File Setup

## Required Video File

Please add the video file `chatbot_demo_video.mov` to the `/public` directory.

The landing page expects this video to demonstrate the chatbot functionality.

**Expected path**: `/public/chatbot_demo_video.mov`

## Video Requirements
- Format: .mov (or .mp4 for better web compatibility)
- Should demonstrate the chatbot answering user questions
- Will be displayed at 50% page width with ambient green glow
- Will have particle animations converging towards it

## Alternative
If the .mov file has compatibility issues, consider converting to .mp4 for better browser support.
